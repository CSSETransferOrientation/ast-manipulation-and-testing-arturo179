## Submission Instructions

Commit your completed program in the `binexp_parser.py` file. Note that you
may throw away all of the starting code that you find there, but the program
should execute all of your tests simply by running it with
`./binexp_parser.py` or `python3 binexp_parser.py`. 

You should also either delete or rename this `README.md` file and replace it
with your own. Your submitted `README.md` file should:

1. Briefly state how much of the project you completed, e.g. which of the
   sub tasks work.
2. Briefly discuss one thing you learned by completing this assignment that
   you believe will be valuable to you in your future courses / programming
experiences.
3. Briefly discuss either one aspect of this assignment you did not enjoy or
   one particular difficult bug you encountered.

1. I was able to complete the mutiplicitive identiyt and the aditive and the test bench works for all test I have created.\
2. The test case frame work is my first thought because it finally make it easy to see where it failed and how to target separately from the rest of the program. 
3. It was just setting up the testing frame work in the unit testing since it was the first time seeing it, but collaberating with others helped tremendoulsy. 


Thank you to Dr. Aaron Keen and Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni for their help in
brainstorming this assignment!
